                        <p>
                            The Glyph-Blade is a 1.2m relic of sleek, ancient
                            steel, its edge shimmering with an azure glow. Runes
                            etched along its length pulse faintly, casting a
                            cerulean light that dances like liquid flame. Forged
                            in the Spire of Dawn, its hilt is worn yet elegant,
                            wrapped in faded leather, a testament to centuries
                            of guardianship (Story Ch. 1, Spire of Dawn).

                        <h2>Lore</h2>
                        <p>
                            Born in the Spire of Dawn’s prime, the Glyph-Blade
                            was crafted by the First Guardians to channel the
                            Valley’s light against encroaching shadow. Its azure
                            hum sings of lost ages, a relic of hope now wielded
                            by Aria to banish Umbraeth. Legends say it once
                            felled a shadow titan, its runes binding the beast’s
                            essence (Spire of Dawn Profile).
                        <blockquote>
                            “Its light cuts deeper than steel—Umbraeth will feel
                            its sting.”
                        </blockquote>

                            The Glyph-Blade strikes with precision and power,
                            slicing at 7.6 m/s, its azure glow amplifying each
                            blow. Tied to the Spire’s magic, it channels light
                            to weaken shadow-based foes, making it a key weapon
                            in Aria’s arsenal against Umbraeth’s corruption
                            (Aria Profile).

                            Forged in the Spire of Dawn before its fall, the
                            Glyph-Blade was entrusted to the Last Guardians as
                            Umbraeth’s shadow grew. Passed down through
                            generations, it found Aria in Chapter 1, its glow
                            reigniting as she claimed her destiny (Story Ch. 1).

                            The Glyph-Blade is Aria’s cornerstone, cutting

                            secrets. Its light guides her path, pivotal in
                            battles at the Spire and beyond, cementing her as
                            the Last Guardian (Story Ch. 1-4).

                            with Umbraeth’s fall, its runes etching a new legend
                            into the Valley (Story Ch. 7).
