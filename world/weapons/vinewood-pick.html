                            The Vinewood Pick is a 1m staff of gnarled vinewood,
                            its surface alive with a faint green glow. Twisted
                            vines form its haft, culminating in a sharp, curved
                            steel tip weathered by ash and flame. Its organic
                            design pulses subtly, a relic of the Cave of Flames’
                            harsh beauty (Story Ch. 2, Talyn Profile).

                        <p>
                            Crafted from the living roots of the Cave of Flames,
                            the Vinewood Pick was forged by early survivors to
                            break through stone and fend off threats. Its green
                            glow whispers of the jungle’s resilience, now
                            wielded by Talyn to carve a path alongside Aria
                            (Cave of Flames Profile).

                            The Vinewood Pick strikes at 7.3 m/s, its green glow
                            channeling minor environmental magic to shatter
                            obstacles or stun foes. Its living essence aids
                            Talyn in navigating treacherous terrain (Story Ch.
                            2).

                            jungle vines with forged steel. Talyn claimed it in
                            Chapter 2, its glow a lifeline amidst ash and ruin
                            (Story Ch. 2).

                            journey through the jungle’s heart (Story Ch. 2-3).
