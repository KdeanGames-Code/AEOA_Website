                        <p>
                            The Wind Flute is a 0.8m relic of polished bone, its
                            surface shimmering with a soft blue glow. Delicate
                            carvings of wind currents adorn its length, with
                            tiny holes that hum faintly when touched by air. Its
                            elegant form belies its ancient power (Story Ch. 3,
                            Liora Profile).

                        <p>
                            Crafted in the Temple of Echoes by mystics of old,
                            the Wind Flute was designed to harness the wind’s
                            voice, calming chaos and binding allies. Its blue
                            glow resonates with serenity, now played by Liora to
                            soothe Umbraeth’s discord (Temple of Echoes
                            Profile).
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            “Its song stills the storm—peace is its power.”

                        <p>
                            The Wind Flute emits calming soundwaves in an 8m
                            radius, its blue glow pacifying foes and bolstering
                            allies. Liora uses it to disrupt Umbraeth’s casters
                            and unify her companions (Story Ch. 3).

                            Forged in the Temple of Echoes’ sacred halls, the
                            Wind Flute was a gift to the first windchanters, its
                            melodies a shield against chaos. Liora found it in
                            Chapter 3, its glow awakening as she joined Aria’s
                            quest (Story Ch. 3).

                            of Echoes, its melodies countering Umbraeth’s
                            casters and easing tensions in Aria’s group. It’s
                            vital for unity and survival (Story Ch. 3-4).

                            herald Umbraeth’s end (Story Ch. 7).
