                        <p>
                            Aria is a blazing force of resolve, her spirit
                            tempered by Elyra’s sacrifice and the Valley’s
                            whispers. Agile and resourceful, she cuts through
                            peril with a sharp mind and sharper blade, her guilt
                            over her mother’s fall fueling a relentless drive to
                            banish Umbraeth’s shadow. Quick-witted and
                            steadfast, she trusts allies like Ryn and faces foes
                            like Kael with unyielding steel, her bond with the
                            land a quiet strength that hums through her every
                            step.

                        <h2>Appearance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Aria stands fierce and scarred, her fiery
                            reddish-orange hair streaked with silver flowing
                            like wildfire in the Valley’s winds. She wears a
                            battle-worn leather jerkin, patched with hides and
                            etched with faint gold runes that pulse with azure
                            light. Beneath, a faded blue tunic clings to her
                            sweat-soaked frame, while scuffed leather arm guards
                            and leggings bear vine motifs, scarred from raptor
                            talons and jungle thorns. Her sturdy boots, muddied
                            from the Living Jungle, ground her as she wields the
                            Glyph-Blade, its ghostly edge humming with ancient
                            magic.

                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            Born of Elyra’s blood, Aria was a child when
                            tendrils dragged her mother into the Abyssal Rift,
                            the Heartstone’s glow fading in her grasp. Hidden in
                            a Spire crevice, she survived on instinct, growing
                            amidst kapok jungles and fractured ruins. Elyra’s
                            sacrifice—her life for the Heartstone—etched a vow
                            into Aria’s soul: reclaim her lineage and purify the
                            land. Raised by the Valley’s echoes, she learned its
                            secrets—glyphs, mechanisms, shadows—emerging as the
                            Last Guardian to face Umbraeth’s hunger.

                        <h2>Abilities & Skills</h2>
                        <p>
                            Aria’s prowess is a dance of blade and cunning. Her
                            Glyph-Blade sings with melee mastery, chaining swift
                            combos or shattering stone with precise strikes, its
                            azure glow flaring with the Heartstone’s light. Her
                            Rune-Etched Quiver looses arrows tipped with ember
                            or ice, piercing raptor wings or golem cores. Relics
                            like the Gauntlet of Storms summon gusts, the
                            Vineweaver’s Cord swings her through jungles, and
                            the Shadowfang Claw leeches life from foes. She
                            bends the Valley’s hazards—quicksand, fires,
                            winds—to her will, a guardian’s art honed in blood
                            and shadow.

                            Aria’s quest drives the Valley’s heartbeat. From
                            claiming the Heartstone at the Spire of Dawn to
                            confronting Umbraeth’s grotesque shadow in the
                            Abyssal Rift, she battles to banish corruption. Each
                            step—jungle trials, desert crucibles, temple
                            mazes—shapes her into a legend, her choices at the
                            Tribal Enclave forging peace or ruin. Elyra’s vision
                            guides her, Umbraeth’s taunts test her, and the
                            Valley’s rebirth crowns her tale, a flame eternal
                            etched into the Spire’s ochre mural.

                        <p>
                            Aria begins as a survivor, haunted by Elyra’s fall,
                            her blade a desperate shield. Through jungle thorns,
                            desert sands, and temple echoes, she grows—claiming
                            relics, solving puzzles, felling foes. At the Rift,
                            she faces Umbraeth, her guilt burning into defiance
                            as Elyra’s vision lifts her. Her triumph atop the
                            Wind’s Roost crowns her a legend, the Valley’s song
                            restored, her fiery hair etched among the Ancients—a
                            guardian reborn from shadow into light.
