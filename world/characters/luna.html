                        <p>
                            Luna is a slender, ethereal woman, her frame
                            graceful yet weathered from years under the High
                            Peaks’ moonlit skies. Her platinum-blonde hair flows
                            like a moonbeam, streaked with frost and tied
                            loosely with a raptor feather strip that shimmers
                            with lunar dust. Her silver-gray eyes, luminous as a
                            crescent moon, gleam with a guardian’s serenity,
                            shadowed by the weight of vigilance against
                            Umbraeth’s curse. Her pale, smooth skin bears faint
                            scars from raptor strikes and gruntling raids, her
                            serene form cloaked in the Valley’s snowy decay.

                        <p>
                            Serene and vigilant, Luna’s voice is a quiet murmur
                            carrying the weight of lunar winds, edged with
                            gentle Canuck wisdom. Her core traits—serenity and
                            perception—shine as she guards the High Peaks’
                            moonlit skies, her silver-gray eyes alight with duty
                            against Umbraeth’s shadow. Calm but resolute, her
                            warmth lies beneath years of solitude, her wisdom a
                            spark of hope. She’s slow to act, her serenity
                            risking passivity, but her quiet isolation masks a
                            fierce determination to protect the Valley’s light.
                            Her gentle humor often belies the depth of her
                            resolve, and she finds peace in the moon’s phases,
                            guiding her actions with lunar insight.

                            Luna’s prowess as the Moonlit Guardian is rooted in
                            her perception, scanning moonlit skies to sense
                            Umbraeth’s corruption or reveal ancient paths. Her
                            Moon Orb glows with lunar light to unlock celestial
                            secrets, and her support skills aid Aria with moon
                            knowledge or frost shards for traps (+10 Stamina).
                            Her essence pulses faintly, tied to the Valley’s
                            moon magic, illuminating secrets with her orb’s
                            light (+5% puzzle visibility).

                        <p>
                            Born in the High Peaks, Luna was raised by her
                            mother, Selene, a moonlit guardian who taught her to
                            read the moon’s phases and guard against shadow:
                            "Watch the moon, child—shadow dims its glow." At 20,
                            Selene fell to raptor dives, leaving Luna her Moon
                            Orb and a creed etched in frost: "Guard the moon, no
                            matter the dark." Decades under Umbraeth’s curse
                            honed her perception and serenity. Meeting Aria in
                            Chapters 6-7, Luna sees Elyra’s fiery legacy in her:
                            "Your fire shines like the moon’s full bloom—don’t
                            let shadow eclipse us."

                            Luna bolsters Aria’s quest in Chapters 6-7, guarding
                            the High Peaks with her moon lore. Her Moon Orb
                            solves the Lunar Echo Puzzle, her quietness testing
                            Aria’s leadership. Her choices shape the peaks’
                            fate—moonlight singing or shadows deepening—as she
                            evolves from a solitary guardian to a steadfast
                            ally, her moons singing hope by the tale’s end.

                        <p>
                            Luna begins serene and isolated, her platinum-blonde
                            hair trembling under Umbraeth’s shadow, her hope
                            nearly snuffed by raptor strikes. Aria’s fiery
                            resolve steadies her, and by Lunar Echo, she aids
                            freely, her quiet wisdom softening: “You’re a blaze,
                            fire-hair—I’ll guard your light, eh, for the moon!”
                            By the end, she’s a guardian reborn, her cloak and
                            orb scarred but unyielding, a legend in the Valley’s
                            rebirth.
