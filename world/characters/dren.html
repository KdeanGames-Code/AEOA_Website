                        <p>
                            Dren is a lean, gaunt man, his frame worn thin by
                            hunger and exile, a stark contrast to Aria’s fiery
                            vitality. His shaggy brown hair, streaked with dirt
                            and ash, falls wildly over his haunted green eyes,
                            which flicker with defiance and shame. Pale skin,
                            scarred from blades and falls, tells a story of
                            survival, while his ragged hides—patched with
                            leaves—and scuffed leather boots bear the marks of
                            the Valley’s harsh cliffs.

                        <h2>Personality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Broken yet defiant, Dren carries the weight of shame
                            from his exile, his resilience and loyalty driving
                            him toward redemption. He’s a shadow to Aria’s
                            light, his desperation fueling a fierce need to
                            prove his worth. Quick with dry quips, he masks his
                            haunted past, but his loyalty shines once trust is
                            earned, though his rashness can falter under
                            pressure.

                            Dren excels in agility-based combat, wielding a
                            battered knife with desperate precision. Years of
                            exile have sharpened his survivor’s instincts,
                            making him swift and resourceful in battle, though
                            his stamina wanes under prolonged strain.

                        <p>
                            Born in the Tribal Enclave, Dren was exiled at 25 by
                            Kael, branded weak after a failed raid. For four
                            years, he scavenged the foothills and jungles,
                            surviving on scraps until he met Aria in Chapter 3.
                            Her fiery resolve offers him a chance to fight back
                            and reclaim his honor.

                            Dren aids Aria against Kael, his loyalty and
                            desperation shaping the Tribal Enclave’s fate. His

                            her quest, his actions on the cliffs proving pivotal
                            in the struggle against tyranny.

                            by exile. Aria’s resolve lifts him, turning
                            desperation into purpose. By the end, he stands
                            redeemed, a loyal ally whose scars mark a journey
                            from shadow to hope.
