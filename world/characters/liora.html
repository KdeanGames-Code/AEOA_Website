                        <p>
                            Liora is stern and wise, her voice a sharp rasp
                            carrying the weight of the Temple's echoes, yet
                            tempered by a flicker of hope for the Valley's
                            light. Her core traits—vigilance and
                            perception—shine as she guards the Temple of Echoes,
                            her ice-blue eyes alight with a bitter resolve
                            against Umbraeth's shadow. She's guarded and bitter,
                            her warmth buried beneath years of loss to casters
                            and wind's bite, her hope a fragile note in the
                            chimes' clatter.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "Wind's a fickle beast here—keeps its secrets
                            tighter than a miser's fist, snaps bones like dry
                            twigs, sings mournful tunes of fools I've buried
                            beneath these cracked stones, their echoes rattling
                            my chimes. You've got Elyra's fire blazing in that
                            wild hair, girl—don't let it gutter out, or I'll
                            carve your name beside hers with a bitter note on

                        <p>
                            Liora is a stooped, weathered woman, her frame bent
                            by decades under the Temple of Echoes' wind-sung
                            burden, yet her spirit hums with ancient vigilance.
                            Her gray hair, tangled with tiny chimes clinking
                            like brittle laughter, falls in wispy strands
                            streaked with dust and moss, trembling in the breeze
                            of the central-east maze. Her violet eyes, piercing
                            through the gloom, carry a stern wisdom born of
                            guarding secrets against Umbraeth's curse, shadowed
                            by the weight of lost guardians. Her skin, pale and
                            lined with cracks from wind and time, bears faint
                            scars from gruntling skirmishes, her frail but
                            resolute form cloaked in the Valley's decay, a
                            testament to endurance amidst ruin.

                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            Liora was born near the Temple of Echoes, raised as
                            a guardian's daughter—her mother, Vira, taught her
                            to hear the wind's secrets and guard against shadow,
                            her voice sharp but steady: "Listen to the chimes,
                            child—shadow silences all else." At 25, casters
                            overwhelmed Vira, their dark pulses taking her,
                            leaving Liora her Wind Flute and a creed etched in
                            wind: "Hold the song, no matter the cost." She's
                            guarded the temple through decades of Umbraeth's
                            curse, her gray hair weathering shadow's
                            bite—meeting Aria in Chapter 3, she sees Elyra's
                            fiery legacy in her, a spark worth saving: "Wind's a
                            fickle beast here—don't let it gutter out, or I'll
                            carve your name beside hers with a bitter note on
                            this Wind Flute; I've seen too many fade to shadow's
                            claw."

                        <p>
                            Liora's prowess as the Wind Whisperer is rooted in
                            her perception, sensing the temple's acoustics to
                            solve wind and sound puzzles, her Wind Flute humming
                            faintly to unlock mechanisms. She lacks direct
                            combat skill, her stooped frame unable to wield
                            heavy weapons, but her Support Skills aid
                            Aria—playing her Wind Flute for sonic pulses to stun
                            foes or reveal hidden paths (+10 Stamina, a scarce
                            gift whispered with resolve). Her stamina is low,
                            her endurance tested by age, but her essence pulses
                            faintly, tied to the Valley's magic, illuminating
                            echoes with her chimes' light (+5% puzzle
                            visibility).

                            Liora bolsters Aria's quest in Echoes of the
                            Ancients, her wisdom and vigilance guarding the
                            Temple of Echoes against Umbraeth's shadow in Story
                            Chapter 3. She stands amidst the central-east maze,
                            offering puzzle aid—solving the Wind Turbine Lock
                            and Echo Resonance Puzzle with her Wind Flute, her
                            chimes revealing secrets and paths. Her frailty
                            tests Aria's leadership, her choices shaping the
                            temple's fate—echoes singing or shadows deepening.

                            Liora begins stern and bitter, her gray hair
                            trembling under Umbraeth's shadow, her hope nearly
                            snuffed by casters' curse. Aria's fiery resolve
                            warms her—she aids freely by the Temple's Wind Apex
                            (Wind Flute pulses), her dry resolve softening:
                            "You're a storm walking—I'll guard your echo, girl."
                            By the end, she's a guardian reborn, her cloak and
                            flute scarred but unyielding, a legend in the
                            Valley's rebirth, her chimes singing hope amidst the
                            cliffs.
