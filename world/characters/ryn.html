                        <p>
                            Ryn is a sharp-witted, resourceful scout, his wry
                            humor cutting through the Valley’s dangers like a
                            blade through vines. His core traits—agility,
                            intelligence, and grit—shine as he guides Aria
                            through the wilds, his gray eyes alight with a
                            mischievous yet dependable spirit. Driven by
                            survival and loyalty to Aria’s quest, Ryn’s journey
                            is one of camaraderie, his telescope a tool to
                            uncover treasures worth bleeding for.

                        <p>
                            Ryn is a lean, wiry figure, his scruffy gray fur
                            matted and patchy from jungle thorns and raptor
                            dives. His frame, small and anthropomorphic like a
                            scruffy dog or wolf, is taut and agile, crouched for
                            action amidst the wilds. His gray eyes, sharp as
                            flint, glint with wry humor under the night sky,
                            reflecting his sharp grit and readiness for danger.
                            His fur, weathered and covered in moss or dirt,
                            bears the marks of the Valley’s decay.

                        <p>
                            Ryn is a seasoned scavenger of the Valley of the
                            Ancients, forged by years dodging fangs, thorns, and
                            Umbraeth’s curse in the Living Jungle’s depths. Born
                            amidst the kapok trees and crimson orchids, he’s
                            survived raptor dives and gruntling raids, his gray
                            fur scarred by the Valley’s rot. Meeting Aria at the
                            Spire of Dawn, he hears the wind scream when she
                            claims the Heartstone, recognizing her Elyra’s fire
                            blazing in her wild hair.

                        <p>
                            Ryn’s prowess as a scout is rooted in his agility,
                            allowing him to dodge raptor dives and climb icy
                            cliffs, and his resourcefulness, enabling him to
                            gather natural resources like wood and herbs for
                            crafting or healing. He wields a brass telescope, an
                            old Guardian trick perched like a hawk’s eye,
                            scouting dangers and guiding Aria through hidden
                            paths. His combat skills are lean but fierce—melee
                            strikes with scavenged weapons or environmental
                            tools, like vines or stones, blending combat with
                            terrain utilization.
