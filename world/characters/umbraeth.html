                        <p>
                            Umbraeth is a writhing, formless mass of tendrils
                            and shadow, its edges blurring like smoke made
                            flesh. Towering and vast, its countless hollow voids
                            glow with sickly yellow light, piercing like cursed
                            stars across a nightmarish sky. Its tendrils coil
                            and snap with black ink-like darkness, rippling with
                            faint outlines of lost faces—Ancients and Guardians
                            consumed long ago.

                        <p>
                            Malevolent and cunning, Umbraeth’s voice is a
                            cacophony of stolen screams, dripping with mockery
                            and hunger. Its core traits—predatory will and
                            surgical precision—shine as it twists the Valley’s
                            roots into nightmares, weaving doubt into taunts
                            that erode resolve. Beneath its malice lies a primal
                            fear of light’s defiance, its arrogance blinding it
                            to Aria’s growing strength.

                            Umbraeth’s power is rooted in its relentless,
                            manipulative force. Its Tendril Lash strikes with
                            crushing multi-hit blows, while Umbraeth’s Rage
                            unleashes shadow pulses that sear all in its path.
                            It summons Gruntling Swarms to amplify chaos and
                            corrupts the environment, forcing Aria to fight
                            while solving puzzles.

                        <p>
                            Born of the Ancients’ greed, Umbraeth surged forth
                            when they harnessed the Valley’s magic beyond its
                            limits, consuming their spires in darkness. Elyra’s
                            blood and the Heartstone sealed it sixteen years
                            ago, but its tendrils creep through cracks,
                            corrupting Kael and birthing the Warden of Shadows.
                            Aria’s fiery defiance is its final obstacle.

                            Umbraeth begins as an unseen menace, its arrogance
                            peaking as the Warden rises. Aria’s final stand
                            humbles it, its defeat a testament to light’s
                            endurance, leaving the Valley cleansed of shadow.
