                        <p>
                            Sora is a wiry, weather-beaten man, his frame taut
                            and scarred from years under the High Peaks’ icy
                            gales. His gray-brown hair, wild and tangled like a
                            northern wind’s catch, falls in unruly strands
                            streaked with snow and frost, tied back with a strip
                            of raptor hide. His ice-blue eyes, sharp as a
                            trapper’s gaze, gleam with vigilance, shadowed by
                            the weight of guarding the northern skies against
                            Umbraeth’s curse. His tanned, lined skin bears faint
                            scars from raptor dives and gruntling strikes, his
                            lean form cloaked in the Valley’s snowy decay.

                        <h2>Personality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Sora is rugged and vigilant, his voice a gravelly
                            rumble carrying the weight of northern winds, yet
                            edged with wry humor. His core traits—resilience and
                            perception—shine as he watches the High Peaks’
                            skies, his ice-blue eyes alight with duty against
                            Umbraeth’s shadow. Gruff but loyal, his warmth is
                            buried beneath years of solitude, his wit a spark of
                            levity. His strengths lie in enduring icy gales and
                            spotting threats, while his weakness is his
                            isolation—he’s slow to trust, risking tunnel vision
                            against the creeping curse.

                            myself!"

                        <p>
                            Sora’s prowess as the Northern Sky Watcher is rooted
                            in his perception, scanning starry skies to sense
                            Umbraeth’s corruption or reveal ancient paths. His
                            Sky Telescope glints with starlight to unlock
                            celestial secrets. Lacking combat skill, his Support
                            Skills aid Aria—offering star knowledge or crafting
                            resources like ice shards for traps (+10 Stamina).
                            His stamina endures the peaks’ gales, his essence
                            faintly tied to the Valley’s sky magic.

                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            Born in the High Peaks, Sora was raised as a sky
                            watcher’s son. His father, Torak, taught him to read
                            the stars and guard against shadow, but raptor dives
                            claimed Torak when Sora was 20, leaving him the Sky
                            Telescope and a creed: "Guard the north, no matter
                            the storm." For decades, he’s watched the peaks
                            through Umbraeth’s curse, his gray-brown hair
                            weathering the shadow’s bite—until he meets Aria in
                            Chapters 6-7, seeing in her a spark worth saving.

                            Sora bolsters Aria’s quest in Chapters 6-7, his
                            vigilance guarding the High Peaks against Umbraeth’s
                            shadow. He aids in solving the Wind’s Roost Puzzle
                            with his Sky Telescope, his choices shaping the
                            peaks’ fate—stars singing or shadows deepening. His
                            isolation tests Aria’s leadership, but his guidance
                            proves crucial in the northern trials.

                            Sora starts as a rugged, isolated figure, his hope
                            nearly snuffed by raptor strikes. Aria’s resolve
                            warms him, and by Wind’s Roost, he aids freely, his
                            dry humor softening: “You’re a storm, fire-hair—I’ll
                            stick around for the show!” By the end, he’s a
                            watcher reborn, his cloak and telescope scarred but
                            unyielding, a legend in the Valley’s rebirth.
