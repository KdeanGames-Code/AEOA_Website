                        <p>
                            Talyn is a gritty, wry survivor with a stubborn
                            streak, shaped by the harsh realities of the Living
                            Jungle. He values deeds over words, his sharp brown
                            eyes glinting with a mix of cynicism and quiet
                            resolve. Independent to a fault, he aids Aria not
                            out of sentiment but because her cause aligns with
                            his own enduring spirit.

                        <p>
                            Talyn is a lean, scarred anthropomorphic wolf-like
                            creature, his wiry brown fur tangled and patched
                            with scars from years of jungle survival. His sharp
                            brown eyes pierce through the undergrowth, paired
                            with a wry grin that hints at his resilience. He
                            wears a rugged leather jerkin, stitched with hides
                            and vine thread, a testament to his scavenger life.

                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            Talyn was raised in the Living Jungle, a brutal
                            expanse of kapok trees and predatory insects. His
                            mother, Selka, was killed by a swarm when he was
                            young, leaving him to fend for himself among the
                            vines and thorns. Through sheer endurance, he carved
                            out a life, scavenging and surviving until he
                            crossed paths with Aria in the Cave of Flames.

                            Talyn’s agility lets him navigate the jungle’s
                            tangled paths and dodge its dangers, while his
                            resourcefulness turns scraps into tools or traps. He
                            wields a chipped Vinewood Pick, a versatile weapon
                            for combat and crafting. His skills reflect his
                            survivalist roots, blending practicality with fierce
                            determination.

                            Talyn joins Aria in the Cave of Flames, offering the

                            her quest, guiding her through the Living Jungle’s
                            perils as they face Umbraeth’s shadow together.
