                        <p>
                            Mirra is a frail but hopeful healer, her spirit a
                            flickering light against the encroaching shadows of
                            Umbraeth. Her core traits—compassion and
                            wisdom—shine as she tends to the wounded in the
                            Tribal Enclave, her gray eyes soft with a desperate
                            hope for peace. She’s gentle and nurturing, her
                            warmth a balm to the valley’s wounds, yet her hope
                            is fragile, trembling like her reed totem in the
                            wind.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "We’re frail reeds bending under Kael’s storm, not
                            yet broken—his shadow chokes us, a noose strangling
                            every breath, every flicker of our fires. This
                            Stormforged Spear is our thanks, child—let it sing
                            with Elyra’s fierce spirit; save what he’d crush
                            beneath his heel, for us, for her memory—my
                            strength’s dust scattered on this wind, but you
                            blaze with a fire I can scarcely fathom!"

                        <p>
                            Mirra is a slight, weathered woman, her frame
                            stooped beneath a shawl of woven reeds patched with
                            jungle leaves. Her white hair is wispy and trembling
                            in the wind, her gray eyes soft as ash glowing with
                            desperate hope. She clutches her reed totem in
                            trembling hands, its carved figures glowing faintly
                            with a soft light that smells of dew and earth.

                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            Mirra was born in the Tribal Enclave, raised as a
                            healer’s daughter—her mother, Elara, taught her to
                            mend wounds and soothe spirits, her voice gentle but
                            firm: "Hope is a fragile thing, child—guard it
                            well." At 30, Kael’s raids took Elara, leaving Mirra
                            her reed totem and a creed etched in sorrow: "Heal
                            what you can, endure what you must." She’s tended
                            the enclave through decades of Umbraeth’s curse, her
                            white hair weathering shadow’s bite—meeting Aria in
                            Chapter 3, she sees Elyra’s fiery legacy in her, a
                            spark worth nurturing.

                        <p>
                            Mirra’s prowess as a healer is rooted in her wisdom,
                            sensing the valley’s wounds to mend them with her
                            reed totem, its faint glow illuminating the path to
                            recovery. She lacks direct combat skill, her frail
                            frame unable to wield weapons, but her Support
                            Skills aid Aria—healing wounds with her totem’s
                            light (+20 Health, a scarce gift whispered with
                            hope). Her stamina is low, her endurance tested by
                            age, but her essence pulses faintly, tied to the
                            Valley’s magic, soothing allies with her gentle
                            touch.

                            Mirra bolsters Aria’s quest in Echoes of the
                            Ancients, her compassion and wisdom healing the
                            wounds of the Tribal Enclave against Umbraeth’s
                            shadow in Story Chapter 3. She stands amidst the
                            rocky foothills, offering healing aid—mending wounds
                            with her reed totem and providing solace to the
                            weary. Her frailty tests Aria’s leadership, her
                            choices shaping the enclave’s fate—hope singing or
                            shadows deepening.

                            Mirra begins frail and trembling, her hope nearly
                            snuffed by Kael’s storm and Umbraeth’s shadow.
                            Aria’s fiery resolve warms her—she aids freely by
                            the enclave’s fires (Healing Touch restores), her
                            gentle spirit softening: "You’re a beacon,
                            child—I'll tend your light." By the end, she’s a
                            healer reborn, her shawl and totem scarred but
                            unyielding, a legend in the Valley’s rebirth, her
                            hope singing amidst the cliffs.
