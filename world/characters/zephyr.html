                        <p>
                            Zephyr is a lithe, weathered woman, her frame
                            slender and taut from years dancing through the High
                            Peaks’ icy winds. Her silver-white hair flows wild
                            like a blizzard’s breath, streaked with frost and
                            tied loosely with a raptor feather strip. Her violet
                            eyes gleam with a dancer’s agility, shadowed by
                            vigilance against Umbraeth’s curse. She wears a
                            cloak of patched raptor feathers and frost-weaved
                            cloth, its silvery grays and whites tattered by
                            northern storms, with sturdy leather boots scarred
                            from icy cliffs.

                        <h2>Personality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Graceful and vigilant, Zephyr’s voice is a soft
                            whistle carrying the weight of northern winds, edged
                            with playful Canuck humor. Her core traits—agility
                            and perception—shine as she dances through the High
                            Peaks, her violet eyes alight with duty against
                            Umbraeth’s shadow. She’s lithe but fierce, her
                            warmth buried beneath solitude, her wit a spark of
                            levity. Swift to leap risks, her agility is both
                            strength and weakness, evading gales effortlessly
                            but risking overconfidence. She finds solace in the
                            wind’s song, a quiet resilience shaping her
                            interactions, and her playful banter often hides a
                            deep-seated determination to protect those she
                            dances alongside.

                        <p>
                            Zephyr’s prowess as the High Wind Dancer is rooted
                            in her agility, swift as a gale’s twist, and her
                            perception, sensing the peaks’ winds to solve sky
                            puzzles. Her Wind Ribbon hums faintly to unlock
                            mechanisms, and her support skills aid Aria with
                            gusts that stun foes or reveal paths (+10 Stamina).
                            Her essence pulses faintly, tied to the Valley’s
                            wind magic, illuminating secrets with her ribbon’s
                            light (+5% puzzle visibility).

                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            Born in the High Peaks, Zephyr was raised by her
                            mother, Nia, a wind dancer who taught her to leap
                            cliffs and guard against shadow: "Dance the skies,
                            child—shadow stills all else." At 20, Nia fell to
                            raptor dives, leaving Zephyr her Wind Ribbon and a
                            creed etched in frost: "Guard the wind, no matter
                            the storm." Decades under Umbraeth’s curse honed her
                            agility and perception. Meeting Aria in Chapters
                            6-7, Zephyr sees Elyra’s fiery legacy in her: "Your
                            fire blazes like my wind—I'll dance with you."

                            Zephyr bolsters Aria’s quest in Chapters 6-7,
                            guarding the High Peaks with her wind lore. Her Wind
                            Ribbon solves the Wind’s Roost Puzzle, her
                            recklessness testing Aria’s leadership. Her choices
                            shape the peaks’ fate—winds singing or shadows
                            deepening—as she evolves from a solitary dancer to a
                            steadfast ally, her winds singing hope by the tale’s
                            end.

                        <p>
                            Zephyr begins graceful and reckless, her
                            silver-white hair trembling under Umbraeth’s shadow,
                            her hope nearly snuffed by raptor strikes. Aria’s
                            fiery resolve steadies her, and by Wind’s Roost, she
                            aids freely, her playful humor softening: “You’re a
                            blaze, fire-hair—I’ll leap with you, eh, for the
                            song!” By the end, she’s a dancer reborn, her cloak
                            and ribbon scarred but unyielding, a legend in the
                            Valley’s rebirth.
