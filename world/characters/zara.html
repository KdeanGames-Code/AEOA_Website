                        <p>
                            Zara is resilient and dry, her humor as arid as the
                            sands she calls home. Her core traits—endurance and
                            perception—shine as she guides Aria through the
                            Sunken Sands, her piercing blue eyes alight with a
                            wanderer’s wisdom buried beneath a weathered shell.
                            She’s jaded beyond repair, trusting little beyond
                            her own path, her cynicism a shield forged from
                            years of loss.

                        <p>
                            Zara is a wiry, deeply weathered woman, her tough,
                            cracked skin like sun-baked desert earth, etched
                            with deep lines from years under the blistering sun.
                            Her black hair is cropped short with a scavenged
                            blade, dust-streaked and faintly curled from the
                            heat, tied back with a tattered beige cloth scrap
                            frayed by wind and grit. Her piercing blue eyes
                            glint dryly, shadowed by exhaustion, steady and
                            unflinching even in the face of ruin.

                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            Zara was born in the Sunken Sands, a wanderer’s
                            daughter—her father, Korran, taught her to dodge
                            quicksand and golems, his voice dry as the wind:
                            "Move or die—that’s the desert’s law." At 14, a
                            golem crushed him under its fist, leaving her his
                            Sand Staff and a creed etched in dust: "Keep going,
                            no matter what." She’s roamed the sands since,
                            scavenging relics like the Sandwalker’s Boots—earned
                            from a raptor’s lair after a fight that left her
                            scarred but alive.

                        <p>
                            Zara’s prowess as a desert guide is rooted in her
                            endurance, steady rather than swift, honed by years
                            surviving the sands, and her perception, sensing the
                            desert’s shifts to navigate quicksand and golems.
                            She wields her gnarled Sand Staff, tipped with a
                            raptor claw, for blunt, solid strikes at golem
                            joints or gruntling skulls, glowing amber with
                            ancient magic. Her Sand Blind throws a handful of
                            dust, blinding foes with a fleeting cloud of grit.
