                                of the Valley of the Ancients, a wind-sung

                                with ancient resonance. Its halls reflect both
                                light and shadow, tainted by Umbraeth’s creeping
                                corruption, a sacred enigma Aria must unravel.

                                Shattered reflections line the interior halls,
                                marred by Umbraeth’s black ichor, while gusts

                                Built by the Ancients as a shrine to harness
                                wind and sound, the Temple of Echoes fell silent
                                when Umbraeth’s shadow cracked its mirrors.
                                Elyra’s desperate chant here forged the Echo
                                Chime, a relic lost within, awaiting Aria’s
                                voice to reclaim it.

                            haunt the spires, and Mira, the Echo Keeper, guards
