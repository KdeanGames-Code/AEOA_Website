                                Valley of the Ancients, a festering wound of
                                corruption where Umbraeth’s power seeps
                                unchecked. Jagged stone spires rise from its
                                depths, oozing black ichor, as the air thrums
                                with the Ancients’ shattered seals, a dire
                                proving ground for Aria’s resolve.

                                thing. Twisted spires pierce upward, faintly

                                Once the site of the Ancients’ strongest seal
                                against Umbraeth, the Abyssal Rift became his
                                escape when their magic faltered. Elyra’s final
                                stand stained the stone, forging the Shadow
                                Veil, a lost relic buried in the rift’s depths
                                until Aria’s quest calls it forth.

                            guard the depths, and Zane, the Exiled Blade, haunts
                            the rift, seeking atonement with his dual swords.

                            aligning broken glyphs to unlock the Shadow Veil’s
                            crypt, all while dodging shadowspawn assaults in the

                            dropped by sentinels, glows darkly and boosts

                            The Abyssal Rift thrusts Aria into Umbraeth’s core,

                            his corruption. Zane’s alliance forges a path to

                            nears the Valley’s ultimate clash.
