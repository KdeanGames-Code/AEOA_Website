                                of the Valley of the Ancients, a range of
                                jagged, ice-clad summits shrouded in perpetual
                                snowstorms. Ancient shrines pierce the frozen
                                landscape, their secrets locked in ice and
                                guarded by Umbraeth’s chilling corruption,
                                awaiting Aria’s ascent.

                                Umbraeth’s black ichor stains the snow, seeping
                                from fissures beneath a stormy, ash-grey sky.

                                The Frostveil Peaks once housed the Ancients’
                                sky temples, where they harnessed storms until
                                Umbraeth’s betrayal froze their sanctuaries.
                                Elyra’s final stand echoes here, her sacrifice
                                sealing the Storm Crown deep within, a relic
                                Aria must recover to defy the shadow.

                            Valley’s final confrontation.
