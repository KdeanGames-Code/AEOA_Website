            <h2>The Ember Haven</h2>
            <p>
                The Cave of Flames yawns within the Living Jungle’s dense heart,
                a jagged maw of charred stone framed by blackened kapok stumps,
                their surfaces smoldering with faint embers that cast a
                flickering glow, the air thick with the sharp, acrid bite of ash
                and the musky scent of rot beneath crimson orchids. Ancient
                murals of the Ancients wielding fire against shadow glow faintly
                on damp walls, their ochre figures pulsing with latent magic,
                while raptor nests and insect swarms lurk in the shadows. Here,
                Aria ventures with Talyn, her Glyph-Blade igniting braziers to
                unlock the Ember Shard, each step a fiery duel against
                Umbraeth’s corruption, the cave’s heat a testament to the
                valley’s fiery past.

                        curling amidst the damp, rot-scented air, raptor claw

                        sequence, insects swarming from crevices, the air sharp
                        with acrid heat.
