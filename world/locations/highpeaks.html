                                the Valley of the Ancients, a range of jagged,
                                frost-bitten summits lashed by relentless winds.
                                Ancient watchtowers cling to the cliffs, their
                                stones weathered by time and Umbraeth’s creeping
                                frost, a frozen gauntlet for Aria to conquer.

                                The High Peaks once stood as the Ancients’
                                northern sentinels, their watchtowers guarding
                                against Umbraeth’s rise. Elyra’s stand here
                                against his icy tendrils left the Wind Shard
                                buried in the frost, a relic Aria must claim to
                                harness the gales.
