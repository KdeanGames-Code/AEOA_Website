            <h2>The Jagged Ascent</h2>
            <p>
                The High Peaks rise along the Valley’s northern edge, jagged
                granite spires slashing through storm-laden skies, where howling
                winds carry the whispers of the Ancients’ final stand.
                Snow-dusted ledges cling to icy cliffs, shadowed by raptor nests
                and the eerie glow of Umbraeth’s corruption seeping through
                cracks. Here, Aria climbs with Zephyr, the Sky Warden, her
                Glyph-Blade slicing through gusts to uncover the Windlash Spire,
                Gale Gate, and Frost Vault—each step a test of endurance against
                casters and icy golems, their bond forged in the peaks’
                relentless winds to confront Umbraeth’s final assault.

                        circling under stormy skies.

                        A rune-carved spire atop a peak, its winds whipping
                        blades into a seven-note song—high, low, mid, high, low,
                        mid, high. Aria aligns the blades with Gauntlet Gust,
                        unlocking a path, casters attacking from below.

                        A frozen gate of ice and wind, its runes glowing blue
                        under storm light. Zephyr’s Windlash disperses the gale,
                        revealing a chest with the Sky Shard, icy golems rising
                        from the snow.

                        south—melting the ice to unlock the Frost Cloak, casters
                        casting dark pulses in defense.

                        Windlash fells them, while Aria harvests their souls,
                        their cries echoing off granite.

                        shatters their cores with the Glyph-Blade, their souls
                        gleaming amidst frost, a battle against the cold.

                        victory in their winds,” he declares, revealing a hidden
                        cache with healing ice (+15 Health), forged in the
                        storm.
