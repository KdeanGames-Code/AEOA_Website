            <h2>The Verdant Labyrinth</h2>
            <p>
                The Living Jungle sprawls across the central-west Valley, a
                verdant maze of towering kapok trees, strangler figs, and
                bioluminescent orchids that pulse like forgotten stars. Its
                canopy blots out the sun, leaving shadows thick with venomous
                insects, raptor screeches, and the rustle of ancient ruins
                hidden beneath vines. Here, Aria carves a path through the green
                hell, her Glyph-Blade slashing vines to unveil the Ancients’
                mechanisms—Pulse Dial, Cleansing Falls, Cave of Flames—while
                Talyn’s fire tosses light the way, their steps echoing with the
                jungle’s heartbeat, a crucible for survival against Umbraeth’s
                creeping corruption.

                    <p>
                        A dense tapestry of kapok and figs, its canopy a shroud
                        of emerald, pierced by rare sunbeams. Bioluminescent
                        blooms flicker, guiding Aria through thorns that guard
                        secrets beneath their bite.

                    <p>
                        A vine-choked gear tower hums faintly, its rusted cogs
                        awakening with Aria’s souls. She clears vines with her
                        blade, aligning the dial to raise a root bridge over a
                        chasm, gruntlings swarming mid-task.

                    <p>
                        A rocky cascade washes venom from the air, its mist a
                        halo of purity. Aria topples a boulder with an arrow,
                        redirecting the flow to reveal a chest with the
                        Vineweaver’s Cord, insects buzzing in protest.

                    <h3>Cave of Flames</h3>
                    <p>
                        A jagged maw scorched by torchlight, its walls painted
                        with Ancients wielding fire against shadow. Aria lights
                        three braziers in sequence—per murals—unlocking a
                        platform with the Ember Shard, raptors diving from
                        above.

                    <p>
                        Raptors perch in nests of feathers and bone, their amber
                        eyes tracking Aria’s every move. She dodges their
                        talons, striking with Gauntlet Gusts, their cries
                        shattering the jungle’s silence as souls gleam in their
                        fall.

                    <p>
                        Venomous insects—green carapaces glinting—swarm from
                        undergrowth, their bites searing. Talyn’s Fire Toss
                        ignites vines, scattering them, while Aria harvests
                        their souls, each sting a test of her endurance.

                    <p>
                        A relic of woven vines, humming with agility’s echo,
                        found in a chest beneath the Falls. It lets Aria swing
                        across gaps, its glow a lifeline through the jungle’s
                        deadly embrace, gifted by Talyn’s grit.

                    <p>
                        Talyn’s rugged camp—a patch of scorched earth—holds his
                        Vinewood Pick and a fire pit. “You’ve got your mother’s
                        fire,” he rasps, pointing to a hidden cache with healing
                        herbs (+15 Health), forged in survival’s fire.
