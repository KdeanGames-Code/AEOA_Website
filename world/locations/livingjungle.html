                                expanse of the Valley of the Ancients, a dense
                                tangle of kapok trees, strangler figs, and
                                crimson orchids. This verdant maze teems with
                                life and danger, its beauty masking Umbraeth’s
                                creeping rot and the secrets of the Ancients
                                buried beneath its roots.

                                figs choke ancient stone ruins. Crimson orchids
                                glow faintly along muddy paths, and shallow
                                streams wind through the undergrowth, their
                                waters tinged with Umbraeth’s black ichor. The
                                air is thick with mist, pierced by raptor cries.

                                Once a sacred grove tended by the Ancients, the
                                Living Jungle fell to Umbraeth’s corruption
                                after Elyra’s sacrifice at the Spire. Its
                                glyphs, carved into kapok bark, now pulse dimly,
                                whispering of a lost temple where the Gauntlet
                                of Storms was forged, hidden beneath centuries
                                of overgrowth.

                            slither through the underbrush. Corrupted treants,
                            animated by Umbraeth’s will, guard the ruins, and
                            Ryn, the Silent Hunter, roams here, tracking prey

                            avoid venomous backlash, revealing a path to the
                            Gauntlet of Storms’ resting place.

                            wind bursts to clear obstacles. A Crimson Petal,
                            dropped by defeated treants, boosts agility when

                            The Living Jungle tests Aria’s adaptability, forcing
                            her to wield the Gauntlet of Storms against
                            Umbraeth’s encroaching rot. Her journey through its
                            depths reveals the Ancients’ lost arts and
                            strengthens her bond with Ryn, pushing her toward
                            the Valley’s heart.
