                            The Spire of Dawn stands in the Northwest Clearing
                            of the Valley of the Ancients, a fractured monolith
                            of pale stone wrapped in jagged vines, glowing with
                            azure glyphs. As an ancient relic and the starting
                            point of Aria’s quest, it bears the scars of
                            Umbraeth’s creeping shadow, a testament to the
                            eternal struggle between light and darkness.

                        <p>
                            Located in a lush, green clearing, the Spire is
                            cradled by towering kapok trees, their roots
                            twisting around its base, choked by Umbraeth’s black
                            ichor. The ground is damp and moss-grown, fractured
                            by time, with raptor nests lurking in the shadows
                            under a stormy sky, creating a medieval dark fantasy
                            landscape.

                        <p>
                            Sixteen winters ago, Elyra fell here, struck by
                            Umbraeth’s tendrils, her blood staining the Spire’s
                            ruins as she fought to seal its corruption. Once a
                            beacon of the Ancients’ power, its azure glyphs now
                            whisper of their hubris, marking the beginning of
                            Aria’s journey to reclaim her heritage.

                            amber eyes. Umbraeth’s looming presence haunts the
                            ruins, and Aria may encounter Ryn, the Silent
                            Hunter, offering aid amidst the chaos.

                            wind from the Gauntlet of Storms (found later) to
                            focus a beam onto the Heartstone’s pedestal,
