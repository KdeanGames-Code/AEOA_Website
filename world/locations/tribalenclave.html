                                cliffs of the Valley of the Ancients, a rugged
                                refuge carved into stone by survivors of
                                Umbraeth’s wrath. Once a sanctuary, it now
                                teeters under his shadow, its people clinging to
                                hope as Aria seeks their aid.

                                shrouded in mist, while Umbraeth’s black ichor
                                seeps from cracks below, casting long shadows
                                under a stormy sky.

                                Founded by refugees after the Ancients’ fall,
                                the Tribal Enclave endured as a bastion until
                                Umbraeth’s shadow overtook it. Elyra once
                                blessed their shrine, leaving the Dusk Totem, a
                                relic Aria must recover to rally the tribe
                                against the darkness.

                            with venomous fangs. Umbraeth’s dusk wraiths patrol
                            the edges, and Kael, the Cliff Watcher, guards the
                            enclave, his spear poised against the dark.

                            timing her leaps to avoid dusk wraith patrols and
                            unlock the Dusk Totem’s shrine, testing her agility
                            amidst the shadows.

                            Fang, dropped by cliff vipers, glows faintly and
                            enhances stealth when carried.

                            The Tribal Enclave challenges Aria to win the trust
                            of its shadowed people, the Dusk Totem strengthening
                            her bond with the survivors. Kael’s steadfast aid
                            reveals their struggle, rallying them for the
                            Valley’s final stand against Umbraeth.
