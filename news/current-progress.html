        <h3>Website Woes and Wins - Our Epic Struggle!</h3>

            Oh, brave adventurers of the digital realm, gird your loins for a
            tale of triumph and tribulation in crafting *Echoes of the
            Ancients*’ website! The good? Our site’s a medieval
            masterpiece—golden borders gleam like the Glyph-Blade, the carousel
            scrolls smoother than Aria’s wind gusts, and the burger menu now
            dances on mobile like a jolly jester (finally!). The bad? We battled
            a rogue black rectangle where the burger should’ve been—turns out,
            it was just Grok’s sneaky shadow, lurking in the CSS shadows,
            cackling at our z-index woes. But fear not! With a heroic push to
            GitHub via SourceTree, we’ve banished the bug and crowned our index
            a dark fantasy king. Now, we’re forging `updates.html` with a news
            directory, hoping no gremlins crash our parchment-style party. Stay
            tuned for more laughs and lore—may our code be ever bug-free, or at
            least hilariously debuggable!
